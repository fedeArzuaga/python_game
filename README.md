# Welcome to this python repository

Here you'll find a small game built in python using OOP concepts, just to put in practice all what I have learned on Codecademy.

To play this game, you'll have to:

- Download or clone this repo in your local machine
- Make sure that you have installed [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter in your local machine
- Open the terminal, go to the directory you have downloaded the game, and run it typing "python3 index.py" or "python index.py"

That's it! Enjoy the game and feel free to fork this repo if you find it interesting.
